# C++CudaTransformerX Architecture

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the architecture of the C++CudaTransformerX project, a high-performance implementation of a Transformer model written from scratch in C++ with GPU support using NVIDIA CUDA.

## High-Level Overview
The project is structured into several key components:
- **Tensor Operations**: Custom Tensor class with GPU support.
- **Transformer Model**: Implementation of the Transformer architecture.
- **Data Handling**: Utilities for data loading and preprocessing.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Scripts and functions for training the model and evaluating its performance.
- **Utilities**: Miscellaneous utility functions and scripts.

## Components

### Tensor Operations
- **Tensor Class**: A custom class to handle multi-dimensional arrays with GPU acceleration.
- **CUDA Kernels**: Custom CUDA kernels for efficient tensor operations.

### Transformer Model
- **Encoder**: Implementation of the Transformer encoder.
- **Decoder**: Implementation of the Transformer decoder.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Scaled dot-product attention and multi-head attention mechanisms.
- **Feedforward Networks**: Position-wise feedforward networks.

### Data Handling
- **Data Loaders**: Functions to load and preprocess datasets.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques to augment training data for better generalization.

### Training and Evaluation
- **Training Loop**: Implementation of the training loop with support for mixed precision.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Functions to evaluate model performance on validation and test sets.

### Utilities
- **Configuration**: Scripts to handle configuration settings.
- **Logging**: Utilities for logging training progress and results.

## Data Flow
1. **Data Loading**: Data is loaded and preprocessed using data loaders.
2. **Model Initialization**: The Transformer model is initialized with the specified architecture.
3. **Training**: The training loop iterates over the dataset, updating model parameters.
4. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated on validation and test sets to measure performance.
